[Portuguese banking institution.](https://github.com/mohantechis/Banking_Institution_Project.git)

<img src="images/bank1.png?raw=true"/>

<h4>Skills Used</h4><p>Python, Pandas, Sklearn, Logistic Regression</p>
<h4>Project Objective: </h4><p>The main objective is to predict customers' responses to future marketing campaigns, through classification and regression models, so that the bank can focus its marketing efforts on the most responsive customers. The models would help the bank to secure deposits more efficiently, save marketing costs and reduce undesirable advertisements to customers.

<!-- <h4>Quantifiable Result:</h4><p>we Can Predict Customer's Response with<b>XX<b> accuracy</p> -->

<h4>Quantifiable Result: </h4><p>we Can Predict Customer's Response with<strong> XX</strong> accuracy</p>
