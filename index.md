# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contanct me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on Bike rentals](https://github.com/mohantechis/Seoul_Bike_dataSet.git)

<img src="images/seoul-bikes.jpeg?raw=true"/>

<h4>Skills Used</h4><p>Python,Pandas,Sklearn, Linear Regression</p>
- Used Linear Regression to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were dummied for use in the model
- Dummied categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Fit a multiple linear regression model with high prediction accuracy through iteration

[Portuguese banking institution.
The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).
](https://github.com/mohantechis/Banking_Institution_Project.git)

<h4>Skills Used</h4><p>Python, Pandas, Sklearn, Logistic Regression</p>
- This project analyzes a Portuguese bank's direct phone call marketing campaigns, which aimed to promote term deposits among existing customers. The campaigns were carried out from May 2008 to November 2010.

The main objective is to predict customers' responses to future marketing campaigns, through classification and regression models, so that the bank can focus its marketing efforts on the most responsive customers. The models would help the bank to secure deposits more efficiently, save marketing costs and reduce undesirable advertisements to customers.

[Identifying symptoms of orthopedic patients as normal or abnormal](https://github.com/mohantechis/KNN_NB_Project.git)

<img src="images/knee-brace-ortho.png?raw=true"/>

- Used the K Nearest Neighbours algorithm to classify a patient's condition as normal or abnormal based on various orthopedic parameters
- Compared predictive performance by fitting a Naive Bayes model to the data
- Selected best model based on train and test performance
